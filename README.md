# Auto-Updating Leetcode Progress Displayer

The primary and only purpose of this repository is to give me a way to compare my leetcode progress to that of my friend [Munis](https://github.com/muniss950)

## How to run

This repository isnt really designed to be ran locally, it auto updates readings using github actions, and then deploys the website automatically using netlify

Its kinda meant to just be a thing I can setup and forget about
